   <h3><li>A system architecture that has revolutionized communications and methods of commerce by allowing various computer networks around the world to interconnect. The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the United States Federal Government in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication via computer networks.More than 190 countries are linked into exchanges of data, news and opinions.</li>
    <li>Internet is the short term for "Internetwork". It is also defined as the "Network of Networks". The Internet connects millions of people around the
    world and is used mostly for communication and accessing information. Computers can connect with each other as long as they are connected to the Internet.</li>
   <li>The information that travel through the internet via variety of languages that are called Protocols. Every person that is using the internet has a unique Internet Protocol(IP) address that is unique numbers that are used to identify each computer that is connected to the Internet Protocol that are communicating in a network.</li></h3>
